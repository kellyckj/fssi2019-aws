    "description": "In the mural on Fairmont ('Por Que'), the Virgin is overseeing a Latino youth dying from street violence in the arms of two friends as the grim reaper stands at his feet specter-like. In the all-brown 'Roots' on Fickett St., the trunk of a tree is composed of figures and faces representing aspects of Chicano history."
