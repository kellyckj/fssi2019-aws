    "description": "A tribute to Cecil Furgerson, an important force in the local African American art community. in 1968 he co-founded the Black Arts Council (with Claude Booker) as an advocacy and support group for black artists. He helped organize and run the popular art exhibition at the Watts Summer Festival for several years. In 1985 Fergerson retired as a curatorial assistant at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after starting there as a custodian at age 16. Richard Wyatt considers him a mentor who gave him critical support, especially during his early development.\u00a0Sponsored and commissioned by SPARC.\u00a0Photo: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz"
