    "description": "A homage to Venice Beach founder Abbot Kinney (1850-1920), who developed the Venice Beach Canals as part of his Venice of America plan in 1905. The canals were built to resemble the look and feel of Venice, Italy. Abbot Kinney also established the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve in 1892 with the help of John Muir, which was the forerunner to the Angeles National Forest. Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt"
