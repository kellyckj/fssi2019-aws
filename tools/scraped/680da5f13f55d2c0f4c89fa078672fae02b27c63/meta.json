    "description": "Artists: Supervisor, Mike Alewitz, assisted by Juan Garcia, Mauricio Cabrera, Elden Bookhart, Lydia Velasquez.\u00a0Working people of different nationalities are shown heading from Los Angeles to the well-fortified U.S.-Mexican border. They are determined to break down the border in order to unite the workers on both sides. Meanwhile , bosses from various local industries watch in horror as their profits are threatened. A green slimy monster, symbolizing the system of international capitalism, tries to guard the wealth created by its workers but owned by their employers. The library was founded in 1963 to preserve books and other materials related to such progressive causes as the labor, peace, women's and other movements for social justice. Sponsored and commissioned by SPARC. Photo: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz | Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt"
