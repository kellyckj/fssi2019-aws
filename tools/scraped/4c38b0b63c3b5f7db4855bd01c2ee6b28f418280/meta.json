The mural is divided into four sections with color schemes that correspond to different seasons of the year. The word 'Only' represents winter - Rime, Witness and letters by Vans. The word 'Time' represents spring - Dabs & Myla and letter by Score. The word 'Will' represents summer - Rime and letters by Revok. The word 'Tell' represents fall - Deus and letters by Askew. In 2011 this mural was covered by a wheat paste and was later uncovered. Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt (first one) | Photo \u00a9 Isabel Rojas-Williams"
