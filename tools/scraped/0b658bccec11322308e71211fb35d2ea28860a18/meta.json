    "description": "Painted in the aftermath of the post-Rodney King uprising, 'Open Mind Open Hearts' emphasizes the need for understanding between the different ethnic, economic, and age groups that comprise the local neighborhood. The buildings in the background represent the architecture of the community, from the reconditioned Victorians and the professional class to the cheap stuccoed apartments. The bleeding rose in the center, which bleeds on the roots where the weapons (painted by small children from the neighborhood) are buried, refers to the gang violence that has taken many lives, some on that very corner. The tenderness of the lovers reminds us that love is necessary to conquer the fear and suspicion that divide people, if the future is to learn from the past."
