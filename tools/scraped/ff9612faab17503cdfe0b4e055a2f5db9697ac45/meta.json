    "description": "The chairs are turned, so to speak, in this mural where dozens of film legends sit in a darkened movie theater and look out at us. Errol Flynn is there dressed as Robin Hood. Superman, Woody Allen, Richard Pryor, Woody Woodpecker, Laurel and Hardy, teenagers Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney are all part of the crowd. Bogie and Bacall sit together, sharing the front row with Marylin, Chaplin, a very young Shirley Temple perched on the lap of W.C. Fields (who reportedly hated children), James Dean, and Elizabeth \"Cleopatra\" Taylor with Richard \"Marc Anthony\" Burton. Restored by MCLA in 1995. Photo: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz"
