    "description": "This was one of the first Mexican murals painted in the United States. It has received international attention, in part because its artist was one of Mexico's three most famous muralists (along with Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros). According to Greek mythology, the god Prometheus gave fire - with all its dangers and possibilities - \u00a0to human kind even though as punishment he was chained to a rock for eternity and every day an eagle ripped his flesh and ate his liver.
