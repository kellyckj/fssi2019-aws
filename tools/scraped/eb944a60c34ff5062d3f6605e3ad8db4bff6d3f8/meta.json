    "description": "\"A semi-fantasy of the beach by the pier - with characters some anthropomorphic - summer scene - a naive-style with intense and bright colors. Popular culture with some historical architectural references that are extinct. The intent was to celebrate the wonderful ambiance of Santa Monica with its diversity and the colorful range of it.\"-Magu. Mural located in interior driveway entrance of parking structure #3.
