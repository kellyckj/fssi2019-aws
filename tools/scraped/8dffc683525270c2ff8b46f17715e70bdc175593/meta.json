    "description": "This piece was done as part of the \u201cSkid Row Beautification Project\u201d, and with the cooperation of the building owner who noticed an improvement in his business in the short time it was up.\u00a0Although a potential solution to the mural ban is only weeks away, it won\u2019t be soon enough for some pieces. This piece by Man One and Vyal One was only a few days old, before it was buffed out this morning by the city of LA. The neighborhood has responded positively, with a supportive wheat pasting that reads \u201cThis Wall to Remain Ugly and Brown by the Order of the City of Los Angeles\u201d. These murals are an integral part of cultural expression in the City of Los Angeles, and they need to be treated by the city as such.\u00a0It is important to spread awareness of the rights of artists, and to remind the city that works like these are essential to our identity. \u00a0Photo \u00a9 Crewest Gallery, 2012"
