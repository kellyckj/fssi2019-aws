    "description": "UGLAR Works: Evan Skrederstu, Christopher Brand, Jose A. Lopez, Steve Martinez & Sergio Diaz. This mural features young street artists, such as Ser One on the left, painting portraits of three of the most prominant muralists in Los Angeles: Willie Herr\u00f3n, Kent Twitchell, and Chaz Bojorquez. By juxtaposing the portraits of established muralists with the raw and vibrant street style of the new generation, this mural creates an important dialogue that honors the evolution of public art."
