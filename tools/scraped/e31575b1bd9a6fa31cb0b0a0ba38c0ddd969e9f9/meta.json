    "description": "Painted as an anti-drug message, this mural spoke about the importance of protecting and preserving the family from the evils of illegal narcotics. It was located in the main quad of the Pierce Park apartments in the Pacoima projects where crime and drug use was rampant. I used a Mayan and Masai Warrior to symbolize the Latino and African-American people who primarily lived in those housing units. It was painted over because it was scaring the little kids. Information and Photo couresy of Joe Bravo. (Joebravo.net)"
