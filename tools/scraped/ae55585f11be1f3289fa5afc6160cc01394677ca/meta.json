    "description": "Covers approximately 1850-1949. With less focus on individual heroes. Depicts gold miners, Boulder Dam construction workers, Pony Express riders, etc.Restored in 1985 by Richard Wyatt, because the paint was cracking. In 1925, a small black-owned company, which later became Gold State Mutual, began business as an upstairs storefront operation on South Central Avenue near downtown L.A. Its sole purpose was to provide local African Americans with insurance because no toehr financial institution would. Today Golden State is licensed in 22 states plus the District of Columbia. The original headquarters building was restored and converted into an apartment complex with a day care center and retail stores (doors opened fall 1996). Photo: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz"
