    "description": "\"A reflection of the neighborhood with an emphasis on the women of the area. \u00a0Pacoima artists painting Pacoima people in Pacoima, CA. \u00a0The garden across the lower half of the mural is composed of the official national flowers of all North and Central American countries. \u00a0The monarch is a common symbol for migration and was used to emphasize the mostly immigrant population in the area, including (Ana Hernandez) the Mexico-born volunteer model on the left. \u00a0The loteria cards in the \"stained-glass\" windows reflect traditional Latino culture and new cards were added to better reflect the neighborhood.\u00a0\" - Levi Ponce.\u00a0Painted in February 2013.\u00a0Photo \u00a9 Javier Martinez"
