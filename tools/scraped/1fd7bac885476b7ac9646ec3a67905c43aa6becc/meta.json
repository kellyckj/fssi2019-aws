    "description": "Originally, this mural was monochromatic. The style resembles the \"fineline style\" or jailhouse style that Mister Cartoon is known for tattooing. On the right hand side, it first named the other artist, El Tloko. Since then, it was covered over with the phrase \"The Lost Angel\" while still monochromatic. In (2009/2010?) The mural was given color, and words made to read \"Big Los Angeles.\" Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt"
