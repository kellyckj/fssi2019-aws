    "description": "Danny Trejo was (and still is) a resident of the East San Fernando Valley (where I painted him). Over 20 years ago he was a criminal, felon, and drug addict. After doing time in state penitentiaries, he stopped a life a crime to start an acting career and has never looked back. To this day, he attends local AA and NA meetings and sponsors everyday people struggling with addiction. He is an example of what can be achieved when our efforts are placed toward something positive. People always have a choice to change for the better and he has proven that.
