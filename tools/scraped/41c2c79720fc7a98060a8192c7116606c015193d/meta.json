    "description": "Examples of endangered animals, such as the mountain gorilla, with the message that humanity's treatment of the natural world is killing tens of thousands of species every year. Despite major conservation efforts, the artist believes one-fifth of the earth's species will be lost within 30 years. The text on the right reads: \"With pesticides, pollutants and our chain-saw massacres of whole ecosystems, we are killing tens of thousands of species every year. Despite major conservation efforts, within 30 years we will lose at least one fifth of the planets millions of life-forms forever.\" -Art Attack Studio. Photo \u00a9 Robin Dunitz."
