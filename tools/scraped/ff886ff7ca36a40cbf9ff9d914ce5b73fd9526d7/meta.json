    "description": "This mural, a derivative of a photo taken by Harry Gamboa Jr., was commissioned by the Getty Museum as part of the 2011 Pacific Standard Time Initiative. The mural is based on a procession performance piece, The Walking Mural, \u00a0that took place in 1973 in East Los Angeles. The mural represents a piece that reclaims public space and plays with the idea of Chicano identity. The people in the mural are the core group of the Chicano art collective ASCO. In the left corner is Patssi Valdez dressed as the Virgin Mary. On the right is Gronk dressed as the European tradition of a Christmas tree.\u00a0 While in the center is Willie Herr\u00f3n III as\u00a0The Walking Mural.\u00a0 The three figures on top of Herron's headdress symbolize the transculturation of the Mestizo and European that gave birth to the Chicanos. Photo \u00a9 Isabel Rojas-Williams"
