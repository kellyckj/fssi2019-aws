    "description": "Seated on benches in front are educator Dr. Mary Mcleod Bethune (founder of NCNW in 1935) and current NCNW president Dr. Dorothy Height, plus several anonymous older black women, all of their faces expressing pride and strength. Standing behind them, and benefitting from their courage and perseverance, are entertainer Josephine Baker, TV personality Oprah Winfrey, jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan, and Olympic runner Florence Griffith-Joyner. Through 31 nationally affiliated organizations and over 2oo local chapters, NCNW undertakes a wide variety of community-based projects aimed toward advancing the economic, social, educational, and cultural welfare of black women and others in the United States and abroad. Artists: Supervisor, Alice Patrick, assisted by Daryl Wells, D. McClelland, & Domminic McIntyre. Sponsored and commissioned by SPARC. \u00a0Photo: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz"
