    "description": "IMages of death and bondage linked artistically to the figure of African American men, women, and teens are intended to deliver a strong community message on the health hazards of cigarette smoking. The mural was commissioned as part of a statewide Tobacco Education Campaign, funded by a 25-cent per pack tex on the sale of cigarettes in California."
