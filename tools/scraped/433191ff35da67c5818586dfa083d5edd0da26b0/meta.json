    "description": "John Carlos De Luna assisted by John Garcia. We were so moved by the book ban in Arizona that as a personal protest we moved immediately to talk to the issues as artist. The mural with it\u2019s floating crystal ball and the books that hold all the secrets and knowledge of our ancestry, images such as the \u201cCurandero\u201d (Medicine Man) from the book titled \u201c500 years of Chicano History\u201d, a hummingbird-to represent the forces of creation - the Aztec deity Huitizapochtli - who serves as a native spirit guide and the background swirls represent the cosmos and  the spiral of life that connects all creation. The mural took about three a weeks worth of work to create. Non Commissioned work, Artist Donated Time, Labor and Materials. Documented by Photographer Randi Bartosiak."
