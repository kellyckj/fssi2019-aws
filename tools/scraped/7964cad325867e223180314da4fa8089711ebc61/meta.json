Ismael Cazarez painted the middle  section,  the justice building, the person holding a dead gang member, and  the mountains. Carlos Almaraz had gang members come and do graffiti in the gallery on some of the panels that were exhibited. Los Four consisted of Frank Romero, Carlos Almaraz, Roberto de la Rocha, Judithe Hern\u00e1ndez  and founder Gilbert Luj\u00e1n."
