    "description": "Artist: Manuel Velazquez and 12 youth assistants. Three talented young athletes, victims of gang violence, are memorialized. Their portraits are at the far right. To their left, as a reminder that it can happen to anyone, are children playing who still live in the neighborhood. This mural project developed out of the anguish of the artist over more than a dozen violent deaths of youth he knew during a recent two-year period. The project was fully embraced by the families of those killed. Sponsored and commissioned by SPARC. Photo: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz"
