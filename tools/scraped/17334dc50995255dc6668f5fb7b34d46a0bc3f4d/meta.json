    "description": "Painted on the outside of La Estrella #3 in Highland Park. \"Yes I did originally paint it back in 1999.\u00a0\u00a0Their was a young son of\u00a0an owner who had bought the place, later he sold it, luckily the new\u00a0owners kept it.\u00a0\u00a0This mural was painted at a time when I was living at\u00a0Regeneracion in Highland Park, at that time many Xicanos/as were\u00a0learning about their culture via ceremony, Sundance, sweatlodges, and\u00a0Peyote ceremonies.\u00a0\u00a0That is what is mostly painted inside the fields,\u00a0peyote, medicine wheels a bull in particular like in the Huichol\u00a0ceremony where it is offered or sacrificed.\u00a0\u00a0Also their is a Buddhist\u00a0influence and Lost the Bunny\u00a0\u00a0who is smoking a carrot pipe, Mayan 13,\u00a0mirrors with smoke.\u00a0\u00a0All the words start with L's\u00a0\u00a0and the woman is my\u00a0X girlfriend La Martina and the guitarist my dad, I had recently\u00a0broken up with her and that was my way to get over it.\u00a0\u00a0I took over a\u00a0month and the back wall mural, The 7 Sisters of Creation was\u00a0completely buffed out after the metro came in.\u00a0\u00a0This was all after\u00a0peyote ceremonies in Tonatierra and even one in Compton.\" - Raul Baltazar.\u00a0Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt"
