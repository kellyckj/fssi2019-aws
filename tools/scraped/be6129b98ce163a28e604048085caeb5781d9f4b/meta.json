    "description": "East Los Streetscapers: (David Botello, Wayne Healy, George Yepes) The left wall is Art, featuring playwright Luis Valdez, actor Edward James Olmos, Picasso, and the cave paintings at Lascaux, France. The middle wall is Science, with primatologist Jane Goodall signing to a chimp, an underwater city of the future, and the eruption of Mt. St. Helens. The right wall is Philosophy. Martin Luther King Jr. is coversing with Pancho Villa on violent versus non-violent revolutionary strategies. There are portraits of the figures most associated with the great religions: Jesus, Buddha, Mohammad. Beatle John Lennon and assassinated president John F. Kennedy are also there, along with imagery from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, a classic tale of logic."
