    "description": "James Doolin assisted by James Feruzzi and Myles Jamieson. A grand look at our sprawling metropolis at different stages of its development. The yaer 1870, depicted in the large central panel, was soon after the arrival of the railroad. The final panel (on the mezzanine level) is the artist's concept of the city of the future. 4 panels. MTA Headquarters, interior lobby and mezzanine. Photo \u00a9 Robin Dunitz."
