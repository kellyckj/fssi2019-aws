    "description": "Designed by Ric Danay and created by Art Neri and Sylvia Montana. Nature's interconnectedness is celebrated in this American Indian story inspired by nyth and spirituality. The thunderbird links a central kachina mask design with traditional symbols of the southwestern desert-earth, corn, sun, storm clouds, and rain. Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt."
