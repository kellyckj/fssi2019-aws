    "description": "Porcelain enamel tile featuring photographs of artists from the surrounding community. Located at the Green Line, Avalon Metro Station.\u00a0\"This work honors the unsung heroes in our community. Not the basketball players, the rappers or those who get the so-called commercial glory, but the artists, actors, sculptors, writers, poets, performance artists, painters, filmmakers and musicians who contribute to our world in so many meaningful ways and who form the structure that upholds the community around the station.\" - Willie Middlebrook.\u00a0Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt"
