    "description": "Pacoima Kahlo is a tribute to the Hispanic artist as well as a symbol of the arts movement now happening in Pacoima. I did it on the 1st January to signal my mission for a revolution in the street art of Pacoima this year. The vibrant red represents street art being in full bloom. Description \u00a9 Levi Ponce.
