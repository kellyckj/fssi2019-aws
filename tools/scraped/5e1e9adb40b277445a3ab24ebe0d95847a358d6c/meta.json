    "description": "Artist: Derek John Taylor and other artists from Judson Studios. The gold mosaic symbolizes eternity. Jesus Christ appears as judge (holding the bible) on the south wall, and as the Good Shepard on the north wall. The mosaic murals found elsewhere in the church were all done much earlier, probably in the 1930s and 40sPhoto: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz"
