    "description": "\"In early January 2012 we started an evolving mural for LA Freewalls in Downtown Los Angeles on 7th & Mateo. Beginning with 'Winter' The Overthrone series has taken on a new face on the start of each season. The final chapter 'Fall!' illustrates the death of the king, or otherwise the end of an era. Each painting overthrew the last forcing us to destroy to create and thus create to destroy. New life, death, birth.... Nothing is permanent, kings, art, happiness, pain, even the crown. Time conquers all!\""
