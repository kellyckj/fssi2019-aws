    "description": "The mural is a collaboration using Karen Bystedt's \"Lost Warhol's\" Andy Warhol portraits. \u00a0Moncho1929 states, \"As the artist I wanted to respect the work and image of Andy Warhol while respecting my own style of work. \u00a0The repeated faces refer and pay respect back to Warhol's own repeated silkscreen works and vary in size and focus on his own portrait. \u00a0The stark white background give the colors their own stage and play with contrast of color on white and black on color, repeating the theme of contrast and fusion throughout the work. \u00a0All work was done by hand with no stencils.\"\u00a0All photographs Moncho1929"
