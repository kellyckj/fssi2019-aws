    "description": "One panel is of seven Plains Indian men on horseback. The other is a procession of diversly attired people walking along a figurative timeline from an old California mission toward the Los Angeles City Hall (just completed in 1928, the previous year). This property was originally built as a hotel. However, the 1929 stock market crash led to its demise after only two years in operation. Two years later Dominican nuns bought it and turned it into a Catholic girls' high school. 2 panels. Sponsored and Commissioned by Flintridge Biltmore Hotel. Photo \u00a9 Robin Dunitz."
