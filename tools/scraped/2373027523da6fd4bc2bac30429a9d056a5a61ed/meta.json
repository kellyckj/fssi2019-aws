    "description": "Joaquin Carrillo Murieta (ca. 1829\u2013July 25, 1853?), also called the Mexican or Chilean Robin Hood or the Robin Hood of El Dorado, was a semi-legendary figure in California during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s. He was either an infamous bandit or a Mexican patriot, depending on one's point of view. In order shown: Photo \u00a9 Stephen L.
