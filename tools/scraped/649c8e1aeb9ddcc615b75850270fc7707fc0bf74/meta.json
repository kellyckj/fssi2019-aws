    "description": "Luis Becerra, assisted by F. Nazarius-Almazol, Sabrina Sosa, and Olivia Vargas. Portraits of politically involved writers Ricardo Magon, Pablo Neruda, Maya Angelou, and James Baldwin. Library cutbacks are compared to the burning of books by the early Spanish conquistadors and the Nazis in Germany. A library building is blocked by politicians. An unbalanced scale shows government preference for military spending at the expense of funding for schools and libraries. Photo \u00a9 Ian Robertson-Salt | Photo: \u00a9 Robin Dunitz (last one)"
